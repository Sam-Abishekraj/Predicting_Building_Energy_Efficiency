# Predicting_Building_Energy_Efficiency

Predicting Building Energy Efficiency
This notebook implements a complete Linear Regression project using the Energy Efficiency dataset. We will predict both the Heating Load (Y1) and Cooling Load (Y2) based on building features.

Project Steps:

Load Data: Read the dataset.
Explore Data (EDA): Understand the structure, types, and basic statistics.
Prepare Data: Define features (X) and targets (y), perform train-test split, and scale features.
Train Models: Train separate Linear Regression models for Heating Load and Cooling Load.
Evaluate Models: Assess model performance using standard regression metrics.
Export Models: Save the trained models for future use.
